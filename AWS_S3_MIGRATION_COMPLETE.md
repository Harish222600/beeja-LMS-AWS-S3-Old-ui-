# AWS S3 Migration - COMPLETED ✅

## Migration Summary

The AWS LMS project has been successfully migrated from Supabase Storage to AWS S3. All file storage operations now use AWS S3 buckets for improved scalability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. AWS S3 Configuration
- ✅ Created `backend/config/awsS3.js` - AWS S3 client configuration
- ✅ Created `backend/config/s3Storage.js` - S3 bucket management and file validation
- ✅ Configured environment variables for AWS credentials

### 2. S3 Upload Utilities
- ✅ Created `backend/utils/s3Uploader.js` - Main S3 upload functions
- ✅ Created `backend/utils/s3ChunkedVideoUploader.js` - Chunked upload for large videos
- ✅ Implemented image resizing and optimization for S3

### 3. Database Models Updated
- ✅ Updated `backend/models/chunkedVideo.js` to work with S3

### 4. Controllers Migration
- ✅ Updated `backend/controllers/course.js` - Course thumbnail uploads to S3
- ✅ Updated `backend/controllers/subSection.js` - Video uploads to S3
- ✅ Updated `backend/controllers/upload.js` - Direct upload handling for S3
- ✅ Updated `backend/controllers/profile.js` - Profile image uploads to S3

### 5. Routes Updated
- ✅ Updated `backend/routes/chunkedUpload.js` - Chunked upload routes for S3

### 6. Cleanup
- ✅ Removed Supabase configuration files:
  - `backend/config/supabase.js`
  - `backend/config/supabaseAdmin.js`
  - `backend/config/supabaseStorage.js`
- ✅ Removed Supabase utility files:
  - `backend/utils/supabaseUploader.js`
  - `backend/utils/supabaseHelper.js`
  - `backend/utils/chunkedVideoUploader.js` (old Supabase version)
- ✅ Removed Supabase scripts:
  - `backend/scripts/migrateToSupabase.js`
  - `backend/scripts/testSupabaseConnection.js`
  - `backend/scripts/fixVideosDurationSupabase.js`
  - `backend/scripts/setupSupabaseBuckets.sql`
- ✅ Updated `backend/package.json` - Removed Supabase dependencies

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET_IMAGES=your-images-bucket-name
AWS_S3_BUCKET_VIDEOS=your-videos-bucket-name
AWS_S3_BUCKET_DOCUMENTS=your-documents-bucket-name
```

## 📦 S3 Bucket Structure

The migration uses three separate S3 buckets for better organization:

### Images Bucket (`AWS_S3_BUCKET_IMAGES`)
- Course thumbnails: `courses/`
- Profile images: `profiles/`
- Category images: `categories/`

### Videos Bucket (`AWS_S3_BUCKET_VIDEOS`)
- Course videos: `videos/`
- Chunked uploads: `chunks/`

### Documents Bucket (`AWS_S3_BUCKET_DOCUMENTS`)
- Certificates: `certificates/`
- Other documents: `documents/`

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Chunked Upload Support
- Large video files (>100MB) automatically use chunked upload
- Resumable uploads for better reliability
- Progress tracking and error handling

### 2. Image Optimization
- Automatic image resizing and compression
- WebP format conversion for better performance
- Quality optimization based on file type

### 3. File Validation
- Comprehensive file type validation
- Size limits per file type
- Security checks for malicious files

### 4. Error Handling
- Detailed error messages for upload failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- Graceful fallback handling

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Deploy AWS S3 Buckets**: Create the required S3 buckets in your AWS account
2. **Configure IAM Permissions**: Set up proper IAM roles and policies
3. **Update Environment Variables**: Add AWS credentials to your environment
4. **Test Upload Functionality**: Verify all upload features work correctly
5. **Monitor Performance**: Set up CloudWatch monitoring for S3 operations

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All uploads use signed URLs for secure direct uploads
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- Size limits prevent abuse
- IAM policies restrict access to authorized operations only

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- Separate buckets allow for different storage classes
- Lifecycle policies can be configured for cost savings
- CloudFront CDN can be added for global content delivery

## 🛠️ Maintenance

- Regular cleanup of incomplete chunked uploads
- Monitor S3 storage usage and costs
- Update AWS SDK versions periodically
- Review and update IAM policies as needed
